# Work Forest

> A pattern for parallel AI-assisted development using git worktrees and file-based plans.

## The Pattern

- **Folder structure**: Base repos alongside feature worktrees in ~/projects/
- **Planning documents**: Files with short unique IDs (e.g., 3el7f-feature.md)
- **Work clusters**: Split large tasks into parallel semantic pieces
- **Stacked PRs**: Clean commits for easier reviews

## Key Points

- Not a tool, just a workflow pattern
- Works with any git-based project
- Plans survive session resets
- AI agents can spawn sub-agents for parallel work

## Tooling

- [Bearing](https://bearing.dev): Tooling that implements this pattern
- [Examples](https://github.com/joshribakoff/workforest.space/tree/examples): Helper scripts in Bash, Python, Node, Go
