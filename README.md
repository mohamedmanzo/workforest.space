## 🧑‍💻 Getting Familiar with the Features

Work Forest offers several helpful features to boost your development efficiency:

### 🔄 Git Submodules + npm link
When developing projects that rely on libraries:

1. Use git submodules to track your library versions.
2. Use `npm link` to develop locally.
3. Commit submodule references to keep versions locked.
4. Refer to the [npm-link pattern](/patterns/npm-link) for more information.

### 🗂 Projects Folder Structure
Organize your projects effectively by committing your `~/.claude/projects/` folder to version control:

```
~/.claude/projects/
├── -Users-you-Projects-myapp/
│   ├── CLAUDE.md          # Project instructions
│   └── skills/            # Custom skills/commands
└── ...
```

This approach helps preserve context across sessions and devices.
